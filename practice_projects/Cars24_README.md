### Project Title: Cars24 Used Car Price Valuation Model Building
This notebook predicts car prices using machine learning. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle Datasets - [Used Car Price Data from Cars24 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanrajput16/used-car-price-data-from-cars24) and contains details like manufacturing year, engine capacity, transmission type, fuel type, and ownership.
#### Workflow:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized the data to understand patterns and distributions.
Model Training: Trained multiple regression models (like XGBoost) for price prediction.
Explainability: Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret feature importance and model behavior.
