### Project Title: RFM-Based Customer Segmentation Analysis

#### Objective:
To segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model, enabling data-driven insights for targeted marketing strategies.
#### Approach:
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed transactional data.
Feature Engineering: Calculated RFM metrics:
Recency (R): Number of days since the customer’s last purchase.
Frequency (F): Total number of transactions made by the customer.
Monetary Value (M): Total amount spent by the customer.
#### RFM Scoring: Assigned scores (Low, Mid, High) for each metric based on value distribution:
Low: Bottom 33% of values.
Mid: Middle 33% of values.
High: Top 33% of values.
#### Customer Segmentation: Combined RFM scores to create distinct customer segments (e.g., High Recency – High Frequency – High Monetary = Top Customers).
#### Outcome:
Generated well-defined customer groups for more effective personalized marketing and retention strategies.
