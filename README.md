# Data-science-projects
This repository contains a collection of data science projects Iâ€™ve worked on, covering various aspects of machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis.

## Cars24 Price Prediction Project
This notebook predicts car prices using machine learning. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle Datasets and contains details like manufacturing year, engine capacity, transmission type, fuel type, and ownership.
### Workflow:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaned and visualized the data to understand patterns and distributions.
Model Training: Trained multiple regression models (like XGBoost) for price prediction.
Explainability: Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret feature importance and model behavior.
